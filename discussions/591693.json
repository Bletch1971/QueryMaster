But it doesn't work either! I wrote a test application that calls GetInfo and then calls GetPlayers.\r<br />\n<br />\nFirts request works fine, I can see server's information. But player request fails with SocketException. Here is printscreen: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmma9mn7iuwha88/1.png?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmma9mn7iuwha88/1.png?dl=0</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nThe error says &quot;A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond&quot;. This is 10060 error or SocketError.Timeout.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n  Exception states  SocketError.Timeout. which means server did not respond within in the time u have set(ReceiveTimeout).\r<br />\nU can fix it  increasing  Receive timeout, retrying.but since u mentioned that u r facing same problem with PHP-script, I guess it may be server problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nI would be releasing Querymaster 3.0 by first week of June.It would have many features.(including retry logic).\r<br />\nso stay tuned.......<br />\n",

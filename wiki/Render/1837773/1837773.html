<div class="wikidoc"><h2>MasterServer</h2>Has methods to query master server.<br /><br />Valve&#39;s master server throttles communication with clients to 30 packets per minute.<br />If this limit is exceeded,master server wont respond for  few minutes.<br /><br />1 packet = 1 batch = 231 addressess<br /><br />So instead of fetching all ips at once(as in earlier version),user can now  choose how many batches to fetch, thus helps in controlling number of request.<br /><br />A new method(GetNextBatch) is also been added to get rest of the batches.<br /><br />The IpReceivedCallback has been removed.It now uses BatchInfoReceivedCallback,which provides an instance of BatchInfo class.<br />BatchInfo class has a flag &quot;IsLastBatch&quot; which tells if the received batch is last or not.<br />The last ip &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; is also been removed from lastbatch.<br />thus with this update,there is no need to check if last ip in the received list is &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; or to remove it from the received list.<br /><br />Retry functionality and callback for each attempt has also been included.<br />Since there is always a chance that server replied but wasn&#39;t received,AttemptCallback helps to keep track of such requests.<br /><br />IPFilter is also updated with new parameters.<br /><br /><br />Read documentation for more details.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
